### Getting started
The main program to run is games.py.  There are three games:

## Alien invasion
Shoot down all the aliens. Use the arrow keys to move the ship
 and the space button to fire bullets.
You have four attempts to clear the screen

## Lunar lander
Land on the green area on the moon.
Use the up arrow or Space bar to fire main rockets.  
Use the left and right arrows to fire lateral thrusters.
All readings must be green and amber for a successful landing.

## Memory game
Match the cards to clear them. 
You can change the number of cards in the settings module.
change self.memory_rows and self.memory_columns.
There must always be an even number of 36 or less squares.
